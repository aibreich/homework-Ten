### I was unable to have my listeners actually run to show on the console log. I was also unable to get my nav bar to switch colors. It does just stay on their however just wont switch between classes. Also when i was looking it up all i could find were mainly more java script driven code. Which involved me switching my <a> to <li> tags which didnt work either im not sure what i was doing wrong because i tried everything that was gone over in class.
